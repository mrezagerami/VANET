# VANET
Veins is an open source framework for running vehicular network simulations. 
It is based on two well-established simulators: 
OMNeT++, an event-based network simulator, and SUMO, a road traffic simulator. 
It extends these to offer a comprehensive suite of models for IVC simulation.

I simulated urban traffic with a map of a part of Montreal, Canada, with 50, 100 and 1000 vehicles and also I enabled artery as well, and then analyzed the output data.
